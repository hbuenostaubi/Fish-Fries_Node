### Fish and Fries Website

The application is still under development. I'm working on creating the main advertisement page and connecting MongoDB to a menu that can be uploaded from a csv sheet. I want to make it into a table reservation application and a page that will contain information about the restaurant. 

For now the page is connected to below URL:
fishandfries.com.mx

However, for now, to sample the application a new user can register and view some samples that are commented out:
