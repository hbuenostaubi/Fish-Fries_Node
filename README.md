### Project Proposal:

1. **Application Name:** Restaurant Application
2. **Project Topic:** A Restaurant website with login information and other preference information. Possibly keep track of orders and check purchases. I'm not exactly positive if I can
include a payment application, but it would be interesting to see if other information that can be
kept track of within the website. At the end of the day, I think I could be very ambitious or just scale down and track of user preferences.
3. **Motivation:** I feel like there are so many applications where one can purchase ANYTHING, so I think this would be very small scale based on inventory (or meals). Additionally, I think business components are far more challenging since they must be practical. A Restaurant must be able to refresh the menu, keep track of costumers and host their costumer base. Even if I get too ambitious, I can scale down.
4. **Servier-Side Components:** I will have to keep track or unique users, their information, possibly a phone number. Hosting is a big part of a Restaurant and there are many seats to fill, so this could be incorporated. Furthermore, keeping track of a menu and price changes or promotions have to be changed and should be hosted within the application.
