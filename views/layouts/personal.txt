Harrison - all your Mongoose/MongoDB functionality works as specified (so no points were taken off for the below needed changes). Please incorporate the following fixes/comments into HW11 (the Bootstrap functionality is required for HW11):



6. I would recommend pulling out the DB connection and remove the await/terminates as described
 in the Slack homework channel (there's benefits to both ways, but this makes the code
  cleaner).

7. I would start thinking about the key property for your reservation Schema. Because we're
using Mongoose instead of the in-memory store, we automatically get an ObjectId, which is
unique, when we create a document. So, could you use that instead? And how would you pass
it as a parameter to the View page instead of the key? Would you need to display it to the
user (i.e. does it provide any value to the user)? Or maybe it could be their reservation
number? You have options on how to handle this!

1) Maybe make changes to menu then validate on a count for a particular time frame
2) Have someone approve the reservations? Connecting an email fwrding feature?

I did not take off for submitting late, however some functionality is missing/incorrect (see below). You can resubmit for a max score of 9/10.

Missing (-2 pts):

- Need to create a controller module for your domain object (similar to the controller created for Notes in the video lecture).
- Need to place the secret passcode for sessions as an environment variable in IntelliJ.
- The redirect for login error messages is incorrect (missing forward slashes). Also, the error message partial is not included in the login.hbs file.
- Missing the justification for why you chose the specific fields for user registration.
